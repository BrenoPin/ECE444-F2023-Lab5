# Pros and Cons of TDD

PROS:

More modular code: TDD leads to more modular code that is easier to maintain and, by writing tests before code, programmers can more easily understand what each module's role is on its own, as well as inside the project as a whole.

Less Debugging: TDD, as a more automatic way to debug code, leads to less time spent debugging code, and, overall, to less defects later in a project's development


CONS:


Maintenence overhead: TDD introduces more code that must be edited if code functionality changes later in development.

Time/Work commitment: TDD introduces additional code that must be written for each "module" of a system, which takes additional time and effort.

Mindset change: TDD requires the entire development team to agree on its benefits, and change their development styles accodingly. This often takes time and may cause resistance.
